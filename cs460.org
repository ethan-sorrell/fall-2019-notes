** Sensor Classifications
- Proprioceptive
  - Sense of self
- Exteroceptive
  - External Environment
  - Includes things like GPS, compass
- Active
  - emits energy
  - e.g. radar
- Passive
  - receives energy
  - e.g. microphone
** Wheel/motor Sensors
- Optical encoders
  - Measure speed and position associated with wheels/motor
- Incremental (Quadrature) encoders
  - Can help differentiate forward/backward motion (which is not possible with only one sensor)
- Odometry
  - Wheel movement can be used to estimate the robots position/change in position
** Heading sensors
- Heading sensors can be proprioceptive (gyroscope) or exteroceptive (compass)
- Used to determine orientation
- Together with velocity information it can help us estimate movement/position
- Dead reckoning
