* Test 1
** Three D's
- Dull
- Dirty
- Dangerous
** Three Types of Terrain
- UAV :: aerial
- UGV :: ground
- UUV :: underwater
** Sensor Space
- All possible input values readable by sensor
** State Space
- Distinguished from sensor space. Incorporates sensor data
- Distinguished by internal vs external
- Internal state stored as representation or internal model. Includes anything remembered
- Could be partially or fully observable
** Autonomy
- Sensing and acting
** Action
- Achieved through *actuators* driving *effectors*
- Typically for either:
  - Locomottion
  - Manipulation
- Note that nature-inspired locomotion is difficult to implement
** Wheels
- 3 wheels is sufficient for stability
- more than 3 wheels requires suspension
*** 4 types of wheels
1. Castor wheels
2. Swedish wheels
3. Spherical wheels
4. Standard wheels
** Other Locomotion Types
- Tracks
- Wheels
- Legs
- Aerial
** Uses of Perception
- Modeling
- Monitoring
- Surveillance
** Sensor Classifications
- Proprioceptive
  - Sense of self
- Exteroceptive
  - External Environment
  - Includes things like GPS, compass
- Active
  - emits energy
  - e.g. radar
- Passive
  - receives energy
  - e.g. microphone
** Wheel/motor Sensors
- Optical encoders
  - Measure speed and position associated with wheels/motor
- Incremental (Quadrature) encoders
  - Can help differentiate forward/backward motion (which is not possible with only one sensor)
- Odometry
  - Wheel movement can be used to estimate the robots position/change in position
** Heading sensors
- Heading sensors can be proprioceptive (gyroscope) or exteroceptive (compass)
- Used to determine orientation
- Together with velocity information it can help us estimate movement/position
- Dead reckoning
*** Hall-effect Compass
- Small and inexpensive
- Poor resolution
- Slow
*** Flux gate compass
- High resolution
- More accurate
- Larger
- More expensive
*** Magnetic Compass
- Sensitive to magnetic interference
*** Mechanical Gyroscope
- Preserve orientation to a fixed reference frame
- Provides absolute measure for heading
- Angular momentum associated within a spinning wheel keeps the axis stable
  - This allows measurement of a system relative to where it started
*** Optical Gyroscopes
- First commercially used in early 80s in airplanes to measure angular speed
- Two laser beams shot from a single source (clockwise and counterclockwise)
- Laser beam traveling in direction of rotation has slightly shorter path
- Difference in frequency is proportional to angular velocity
** Sensors in Shakey
- camera
- bumper - cat whiskers
- radio
** Kinematics
- How mechanical systems behave
- Why do we need to understand mechanical behavior?
  - Understand how to create control software
- Used for position and motion estimation
- Key differences between manipulator robots and mobile robots
  - There is no direct way to measure a mobile robot's position instantaneously
- Motion estimation can be inaccurate and is subject to error via slippage
- Deriving a model for the whole robot's motion is a bottom-up process
- Each wheel (for instance) contributes to the robot's motion
** Kinematics (cont)
- Establish relationship between global reference frame and local reference frame
- Local (robot) reference frame:
  - Describe position on the plane and orientation {X_R, Y_R, \theta}
- Global reference frame:
  - Described by axes and some origin O {X_I, Y_I}
- Angular difference between global and reference frames is \theta
- Point P is the robot in the global reference {x, y}
- The *orthogonal rotation matrix* (ORM) R(\theta) is used to handle mappings between global and local reference frame
